# Situp Bird - Motion-Controlled Fitness Gaming

A web-based fitness game that transforms the classic Flappy Bird experience into a situp workout. Players use their phone's motion sensors to control the bird by performing situp motions, creating an engaging fitness gaming experience.

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Game Device**: Open the game URL on any device (computer, tablet, TV)
2. **Controller Device**: Open the same URL on a mobile phone
3. **Connect**: Use the 4-digit room code to pair devices
4. **Calibrate**: Follow the motion calibration instructions
5. **Play**: Perform situp motions to make the bird flap and navigate through pipes!

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Players
- **Live Demo**: [Play Situp Bird](https://yourusername.github.io/situp-bird-game) *(Update with your URL)*
- **Requirements**: Modern web browser + mobile device with motion sensors

### For Developers

#### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd situp-bird-game

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test
```

#### Production Deployment
See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete deployment instructions.

**Quick Deploy:**
1. **Backend**: Deploy to [Render](https://render.com) (free tier available)
2. **Frontend**: Deploy to GitHub Pages
3. **Configure**: Update WebSocket URL in `app.js`

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, CSS3
- **Backend**: Node.js, WebSocket (ws library)
- **Sensors**: Generic Sensor API (DeviceMotionEvent)
- **Deployment**: Render (backend) + GitHub Pages (frontend)
- **Testing**: Vitest with comprehensive test suite

## üì± Device Compatibility

### Supported Browsers
- **Chrome**: Full support (recommended)
- **Firefox**: Full support  
- **Safari**: Full support (iOS 13+)
- **Edge**: Full support

### Motion Sensor Requirements
- **iOS**: iPhone/iPad with iOS 13+ (requires permission)
- **Android**: Most modern Android devices
- **Desktop**: No motion sensors (use as game display only)

## üéØ Game Mechanics

### Motion Detection
- **Down State**: Phone tilted back (lying down position)
- **Flap Trigger**: Quick motion from down to up (situp completion)
- **Calibration**: Personalized to your motion range and device orientation
- **Sensitivity**: Adjustable thresholds for different fitness levels

### Scoring System
- **Points**: Earned by successfully passing through pipe gaps
- **Difficulty**: Pipes spawn at intervals based on your calibrated motion range
- **Challenge**: Gap positions adapt to your movement patterns

## üîß Configuration

### Motion Sensitivity (app.js)
```javascript
// Adjust these values for different sensitivity levels
const downThreshold = 0.25; // Lower = more sensitive down detection
const upThreshold = 0.75;   // Higher = more sensitive up detection  
const motionThreshold = 0.2; // Lower = more responsive flap detection
```

### Game Balance (app.js)
```javascript
this.bird = {
    gravity: 0.4,        // Higher = falls faster
    flapStrength: -4.5,  // More negative = stronger flap
    maxVelocity: 10      // Higher = faster movement
};

this.pipeGap = 220;      // Higher = easier gaps
this.pipeSpeed = 1.8;    // Higher = faster pipes
```
